Image Encryption Tool

This project is a simple yet powerful **Image Encryption Tool** built using Python. It leverages **pixel manipulation techniques** to encrypt and decrypt images, providing a basic yet effective form of image security. The tool modifies pixel values using mathematical operations, ensuring the encrypted image looks completely different from the original. Users can decrypt the encrypted image using the same method and key to restore it to its original form.
